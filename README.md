I bet you understand I feel so excited to explore macOS as a new consumer of MacBook Pro, especially with the M1 chip. AppleScript can sometimes be a magic. This repository contains code written for fun to "taste" AppleScript.

## Script Instructions

### [Hidden Files Helper.app](./Hidden%20Files%20Helper.app): 🧐

Although showing/hiding hidden files can be easily achieved by typing `Command` + `Shift` + `.` in the Finder app, it can also be controlled programmaticially. Hidden Files Helper is such an AppleScript app achieving it.

### [Mail Startup Helper.app](./Mail%20Startup%20Helper.app): 📧

It is weired that the Mail app cannot start up with OS, even though the corresponding preference is turned on. It seems to be a bug by searching Google. One way to solve it is to write an AppleScript app, and here it is - Mail Startup Helper!

Hope you also have fun! 💖
