I bet you understand as a new consumer of MacBook I feel funny to explore MacOS. Apple Script can sometimes be a magic. This repository contains code written for fun to "taste" Apple Script.

## Script Instructions

### [Hidden Files Helper.app](./Hidden%20Files%20Helper.app)

Although showing/hiding hidden files can be easily achieved by typing `Command` + `Shift` + `.` in the Finder app, it can also be controlled programmaticially. Hidden Files Helper is such an Apple Script app achieving it.

### [Mail Startup Helper.app](./Mail%20Startup%20Helper.app)

It is weired that the Mail app cannot start up with OS, even though the corresponding preference is turned on. It seems to be a bug by searching Google. One way to solve it is to write an Apple Script app, and here it is - Mail Startup Helper!

## ATTENTION

1. By 6 March 2021, everything looks good with MacOS Big Sur (Version: 11.2.2) on MacBook Pro (M1, 2020).
